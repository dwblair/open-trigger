<h2>Upload an "infrablue" image for processing</h2>

An "infrablue" image is one in which the "red" channel of the (JPEG, PNG, GIF) image contains primarily "near-infrared" information.  Such images can be generated using many inexpensive digital cameras and webcams by removing the infrared block filter in many inexpensive digital cameras, and by then adding on a filter that selectively blocks red light (this is something the Public lab <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/publiclab/infragram-the-infrared-photography-project">Infragram platform</a> nicely accomplishes).  For more info, check out Public Lab's <a href="http://publiclab.org/wiki/near-infrared-camera">guide to near-infrared imaging</a>.
